# Fever Dream Simulator :ok-symbol:

made by Mason Lee Carver (me)

this is a text-based rpg with two "quests", two battles, and two shops. 
you'll have to use your imagination for this one. sorry guys. i'm not an artist unless it's with a pencil. 

chainmail and tuna fish sandwiches are your friends. 
play with epic music in the background to make the experience less painful. 
do not punch the children. unless you want to. 

if you're wondering what's happening... just pretend that you're running a fever of 115 degrees and your brain is going wild.
